         <h2>What is the concept of homework?</h2>
         <p><span class="bold">Homework</span>is the time students spend outside the classroom in assigned activities to practice,<br>
             reinforce or apply newly-acquired skills <br> and knowledge and to learn necessary skills of independent study.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            Extra assignments given to children,<br>
            particularly younger school going children,<br>
            can lead to unhealthy levels of stress, according to research.<br>
            If bombarded with countless lessons at school and at home,<br>
            students may feel stress and anxiety should they fail to complete the assignment on time.<br>
            Students need to learn in a classroom setting,<br>
            but they should also be able to spend some time exploring other things outside of the classroom.

        <p>
            Several studies have found that homework negatively affects the life of school children in many ways.<br>
            Free-time plays a major role in fostering creativity and emotional development â€” factors as important to long-term success as education itself.</p>

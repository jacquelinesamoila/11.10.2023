        <div class="part-1">
            <p>A Fox one day spied a beautiful bunch</p>
            <p>of ripe grapes hanging from a vine trained along the branches of a tree.</p>
            <p>The grapes seemed ready to burst with juice, and the Fox's</p>
            <p>mouth watered as he gazed longingly at them.</p>
            <p>The bunch hung from a high branch, and the Fox had to jump for it.</p>
            <p> The first time he jumped he missed it by a long way.</p>
        </div>
       
         <div class="part-2">
            <p>So he walked off a short distance and took a running leap at it,</p>
            <p> only to fall short once more.</p>
             <p>Again and again he tried, but in vain.</p>
            <p>Now he sat down and looked at the grapes in disgust.</p>
            <p>"What a fool I am," he said.</p>
            <p> "Here I am wearing myself out to get a bunch of</p>
            <p> sour grapes that are not worth gaping for."</p>
            <p>And off he walked very, very scornfully.</p>
